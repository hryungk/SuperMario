# SuperMarioBros
Recreating Super Mario Brothers game by Nintendo but Pusheen as Mario :3

Basic structures of the program are based on Miniventure codes (https://github.com/shylor/miniventure). 


As of 11/11/20:

- The player's physical movement in the map is confirmed. (doesn't intersect with barriers, jumps, falls, etc.)

- The player can attack Goomba by jumping on top of it or by shooting the fire.

- The player can interact with question blocks and bricks. Hidden items pop up.



Essential features to be added soon:

- Update each hidden sprite's behavior once activated. 

- Hidden items' (Mushroom, starman, flower) effects on the player and the game mechanics.
