- The player's physical movement in the map is confirmed. (doesn't intersect with barriers, jumps, falls, etc.)

- The player can attack Goomba by jumping on top of it or by shooting the fire.

- The player can interact with question blocks and bricks. Hidden items pop up.

- Hidden sprites (mushroom, flower, starman) interact and takes in effect as expected.

- Brick with coin has a random number of coins and turn to block once looted out.

- The player should be able to kill Goomba by hitting the brick from the bottom. 

- Print scores based on the player's position
